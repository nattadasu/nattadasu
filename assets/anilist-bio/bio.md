[nattadasu@aniList.co]():[~]()$ cat introduction.txt

I am Natsu Tadama (aliased, but you can also find my real name easily tbh), pronounced as /nats…Ø/ /tadama/ in IPA, and I am "he/him." 21 years old. :3

Talking about myself, I would say that I have become as an otaku (not weeaboo) since February 2016 with my not-so-first anime called "Tokyo Ghoul." However, my first anime I have watched by myself and not broadcasted on television is... Guess what? ITS KISS X SIS (OVA) IN 2009.

I can speak in more than 5 languages: Acehnese, Indonesian, Malay, English, Arabic, and Japanese... With some plot twists, I can read the Cyrillic alphabet and Hangul.

tl;dr: nonsense.

If you really want to know how I rate show/book, below are rough explanation:
 - **1-3**: Horrendous
 - &emsp;&emsp;**4**: *I put too much trust on this title*
 - &emsp;&emsp;**5**: Just... why?
 - &emsp;&emsp;**6**: oh wait, this one is quite enjoyable.
 - &emsp;&emsp;**7**: good title, i like it. img16(https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/589222965535703041.webp?quality=lossless)
 - &emsp;&emsp;**8**: Great title! I might want to revisit it later!
 - &emsp;&emsp;**9**: [***M a s t e r p i e c e***]()
 - &emsp;**10**: [***G o d l y&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;M a s t e r p i e c e***]()
